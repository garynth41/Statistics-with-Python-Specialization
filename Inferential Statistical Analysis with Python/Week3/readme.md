# WEEK 3 - HYPOTHESIS TESTING



In week three, we’ll learn how to test various hypotheses - using the five different analysis methods covered in the previous week. We’ll discuss the importance of various factors and assumptions with hypothesis testing and learn to interpret our results. We will also review how to distinguish which procedure is appropriate for the research question at hand. Quizzes and a peer assessment will appear throughout the week to test your understanding.




## Key Concepts
1. Differentiate between various scenarios and determine the appropriate analysis method
2. Apply techniques of hypothesis testing and interpret the results
3. Run hypothesis tests in Python and interpret the output.
