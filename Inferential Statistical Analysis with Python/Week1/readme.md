# WEEK 1 - OVERVIEW & INFERENCE PROCEDURES



In this first week, we’ll review the course syllabus and discover the various concepts and objectives to be mastered in weeks to come. You’ll be introduced to inference methods and some of the research questions we’ll discuss in the course, as well as an overall framework for making decisions using data, considerations for how you make those decisions, and evaluating errors that you may have made. 

On the Python side, we’ll review some high level concepts from the first course in this series, Python’s statistics landscape, and walk through intermediate level Python concepts. All of the course information on grading, prerequisites, and expectations are on the course syllabus and you can find more information on our Course Resources page.

## Key Concepts
1. Develop an outlook for the course and summarize future concepts and objectives
2. Explain the framework for making decisions using data along with the potential consequences of those decisions
3. Identify the basic concepts central to Bayesian and frequentist statistics, which will be used throughout this course
4. Write basic Python functions and interpret documentation
