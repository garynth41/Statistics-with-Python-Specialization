# WEEK 2 - FITTING MODELS TO INDEPENDENT DATA

In this second week, we’ll introduce you to the basics of two types of regression: linear regression and logistic regression. You’ll get the chance to think about how to fit models, how to assess how well those models fit, and to consider how to interpret those models in the context of the data. You’ll also learn how to implement those models within Python.

## Key Concepts
1. Describe the general ideas of regression, including the relationship between variables and predicting results for new observations.
2. Recognize problem setups and research questions as an appropriate regression framework, either linear and logistic.
3. Interpret output, especially slopes, from the regression models to understand more about the relationship between variables.
4. Assess model fit to determine how appropriate the models might be and limitations to relying on the models.
