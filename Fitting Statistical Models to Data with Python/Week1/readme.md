# WEEK 1 - OVERVIEW & CONSIDERATIONS FOR STATISTICAL MODELING



We begin this third course of the Statistics with Python specialization with an overview of what is meant by “fitting statistical models to data.” In this first week, we will introduce key model fitting concepts, including the distinction between dependent and independent variables, how to account for study designs when fitting models, assessing the quality of model fit, exploring how different types of variables are handled in statistical modeling, and clearly defining the objectives of fitting models.




## Key Concepts
1. Introduce statistics from a modeling perspective and understand what it means to fit models to data.
2. Examine models in the context of fit and uncertainty to evaluate their predictive power.
3. Distinguish between different types of variables and their roles when specifying statistical models.
4. Examine how study design features are accounted for when fitting models.
5. Describe the different inferential objectives that researchers may have when fitting models.
