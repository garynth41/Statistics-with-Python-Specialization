# WEEK 4: Special Topics

In this final week, we introduce special topics that extend the curriculum from previous weeks and courses further. We will cover a broad range of topics such as various types of dependent variables, exploring sampling methods and whether or not to use survey weights when fitting models, and in-depth case studies utilizing Bayesian techniques to derive insights from data. Youâ€™ll also have the opportunity to apply Bayesian techniques in Python.




## Key Concepts
1. Gain exposure to working with other types of outcomes that are common in certain fields such as ordinal, censored, and multinomial variables.
2. Introduce advanced modeling methods that are not a part of the common statistics curriculum.
3. Introduce Bayesian statistics and provide resources for learners to begin exploring methods and methodologies unique to Bayesian methods.
