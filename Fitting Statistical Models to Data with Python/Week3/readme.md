# WEEK 3 - FITTING MODELS TO DEPENDENT DATA


In the third week of this course, we will be building upon the modeling concepts discussed in Week 2. Multilevel and marginal models will be our main topic of discussion, as these models enable researchers to account for dependencies in variables of interest introduced by study designs. Weâ€™ll be covering why and when we fit these alternative models, likelihood ratio tests, as well as fixed effects and their interpretations.


## Key Concepts
1. Explore methods for modeling data with correlated observations.
2. Gain insight into the methods of multilevel and marginal modeling, why we may use them, and when to use one method versus another.
3. Dive deeper into likelihood ratio tests for determining statistically significant differences between models that do and do not account for correlational structures.
4. Compare and contrast inferences that can be made when fitting multilevel and marginal models.
