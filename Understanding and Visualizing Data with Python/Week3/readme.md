# WEEK 3 - MULTIVARIATE DATA



In the third week of this course on looking at data, we’ll introduce key ideas for examining research questions that require looking at more than one variable. In particular, we will consider both numerically and visually how different variables interact, how summaries can appear deceiving if you don’t properly account for interactions, and differences between quantitative and categorical variables. This week’s assignment will consist of a writing assignment along with reviewing those of your peers.

## Key Concepts<br>
1. Create graphs and summary statistics of multivariate data, both categorical and quantitative
2. Summarize important information obtained through visualizations of multivariate data
3. Communicate statistical ideas clearly and concisely to a broad audience
