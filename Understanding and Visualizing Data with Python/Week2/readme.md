# WEEK 2 - UNIVARIATE DATA



In the second week of this course, we will be looking at graphical and numerical interpretations for one variable (univariate data). In particular, we will be creating and analyzing histograms, box plots, and numerical summaries of our data in order to give a basis of analysis for quantitative data and bar charts and pie charts for categorical data. A few key interpretations will be made about our numerical summaries such as mean, IQR, and standard deviation. An assessment is included at the end of the week concerning numerical summaries and interpretations of these summaries.




## Key Concepts<br>
1. Understand the various graphical displays used for univariate categorical and quantitative data
2. Interpret histograms and boxplots to describe quantitative data
3. Obtain key interpretations used for describing quantitative data
4. Create histograms, box plots, and numerical summaries through Python
