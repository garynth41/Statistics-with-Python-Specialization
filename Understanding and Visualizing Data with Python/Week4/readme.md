# WEEK 4 - POPULATIONS AND SAMPLES



In this week, you’ll spend more time thinking about where data come from. The highest-quality statistical analyses of data will always incorporate information about the process used to generate the data, or features of the data collection design. You’ll be exposed to important concepts related to sampling from larger populations, including probability and non-probability sampling, and how we can make inferences about larger populations based on well-designed samples. 

You’ll also learn about the concept of a sampling distribution, and how estimation of the variance of that distribution plays a critical role in making statements about populations. Finally, you’ll learn about the importance of reading the documentation for a given data set; a key step in looking at data is also looking at the available documentation for that data set, which describes how the data were generated.






## Key Concepts
1. Distinguish between probability and non-probability sampling
2. Describe the concept of a sampling distribution, and how one can make inference about a population parameter based on the estimated features of that distribution
3. Identify appropriate analytic techniques for probability and non-probability samples
4. Explain how poorly-designed samples can lead to descriptions of population features that are biased in nature
